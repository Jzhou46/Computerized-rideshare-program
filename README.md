# Computerized-rideshare-program
You have been contacted by Dr. Sidney Bigcheez, the Chancellor of the Southern North Dakota University
(SNDU). Dr. Bigcheez is trying to reduce the cost for university employees who commute to the university
each day by setting up a Computerized Rideshare Program (CRP). Employees typically must drive to the
university due to the lack of public transportation in Southern North Dakota. This drive is time consuming
and increasingly expensive due to the rising cost of gas. Dr. Bigcheez would like for a computer program to
establish “car pools” of commuters. The commuters in each car poor would agree to share rides to SNDU
by taking turns driving to the school. The program would ensure that people in the car pool each do their
fair share of the driving.
