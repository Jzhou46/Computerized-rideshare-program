Each group must work independently of other groups. Project grades will be based on conformance to the criteria of good software engineering. In particular, your designs will be evaluated based on the criteria of completeness, low coupling and high cohesion. Make sure to indicate whether you followed a structured approach for portions of your design. Make sure to include at least 3 patterns for object-oriented design in your design. An implementation should follow directly from your design. Your code will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria. First, the instructor and TAs will examine the quality of your coding style. For instance, we expect that you will thoroughly document your code. Variable and unit names should be indicative of the purpose of the variable or unit (use mnemonic names). Avoid, whenever possible, global variables since the use of these variables often results in unnecessary coupling among units. Second, we will check your code for compliance with the appropriate requirement definition verify compliance of your code with the above specifications.
